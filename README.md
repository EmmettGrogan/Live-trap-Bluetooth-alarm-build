# Live-trap-Bluetooth-alarm-build
build R-pi / BT controlled alarm 

Vision: To engineer a wireless auto-alarm to sound when a squirrel is trapped in Chris Notap's excellent homemade live trap https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QoWJUEs5E0&t=56s

My vision is to install a tilt switch to a Class 1 Bluetooth transmitter who's signal would be received in the house by the Raspberry Pi some 50 meters away.

I have caught 34 squirrels with this device so far in the last 24 months. Each has been relocated far enough away that they do not return. By creating the wireless alarm, I anticipate minimizing the stress to the squirrels.

I see the exercise as having other potential applications, and hope others will share in my enthusiasm.

I expect there is already a groundwork of hardware/software built. I'm new to Python, so any help offered will be most thankfully received.

The squirrels thank you (as do I)
